\section{Forms}
Forms are a big part of the application. Your forms need to be consistent and stylable. The way the Quizzer application solves this problem is by creating AngularJS directives per form field. This way you can guarantee that each control of the same type will be rendered in exactly the same way.

This section will explain the implementation and usage of each of these controls.

\subsection{Text}
The textbox is the main component and the first weâ€™ll look at within this document.

\begin{lstlisting}
// comment

var foo = function(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}{HTML}
<!-- usage -->
<ck-text-m></ck-text-m>
\end{lstlisting}
