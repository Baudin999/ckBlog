\section{AngularJS}
At the root of our application and architecture lies AngularJS\footnote{https://angularjs.org/}. This framework for building web applications and web sites focusses around a MVC type approach to binding your data to your views. 

There are many JavaScript MVC frameworks out there and there are more build every day. The reason I chose AngularJS is that when I started writing single page applications I looked for the most flexible system. A system which did not superimpose rules on how to build your application. I find that every time a framework tries to impose a structure on your application you will always run into limitations of this structure. I have been working with AngularJS for over a year and have not found any such restrictions. I’ve used AngularJS with an ASP.NET MVC backend with a ruby and rails backend but my favourite remains NodeJS\footnote{NodeJS will be explained in a following chapter}.
